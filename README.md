# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Radar
A real-time 180° radar system integrating Arduino and MATLAB. Uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and Servo to scan surroundings, streaming data via Serial to a custom polar-plot GUI. Includes integrated hardware alerts (buzzer/vibration) and high-performance, flicker-free visualization. Perfect for robotics projects!
